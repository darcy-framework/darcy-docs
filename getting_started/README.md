# Getting Started

To get started with darcy, you'll have it import an _implementation_ of its API. At the moment, the only implementation is [darcy-webdriver](https://github.com/darcy-framework/darcy-webdriver), driven by [Selenium WebDriver](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/).

```xml
<groupId>com.redhat.darcy</groupId>
<artifactId>darcy-webdriver</artifactId>
```

For the latest version please see the darcy-webdriver page.
